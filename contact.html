                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">1. What services does Treevance offer?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Treevance provides comprehensive tree care services including tree health assessments, professional pruning, tree removal, planting services, soil management, and municipal tree management programs. Our certified arborists specialize in both residential and commercial tree care, with services tailored to meet your specific needs. We also offer emergency tree services for storm damage situations. Our team uses state-of-the-art equipment and follows industry best practices for all tree care operations.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">For non-emergency service requests, we typically respond within 24-48 hours to schedule an assessment. Emergency services for storm damage or hazardous tree situations receive priority response, often within hours of your call. Response times may vary depending on weather conditions and current workload. During peak seasons (spring and fall), response times may be slightly longer. We always strive to accommodate urgent requests as quickly as possible while maintaining our high standards of quality and safety.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">3. Are your arborists certified and insured?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">All Treevance arborists are ISA (International Society of Arboriculture) certified and maintain ongoing education requirements. We carry comprehensive liability insurance ($2,000,000 coverage) and workers' compensation insurance for all our team members. Certifications are verified annually to ensure compliance with industry standards. Our team also participates in regular safety training and stays current with the latest arboricultural research and techniques. Copies of our insurance certificates are available upon request.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Treevance serves the entire New York metropolitan area including all five boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island), as well as Nassau and Westchester counties. For larger municipal projects, we service communities throughout the tri-state area. Service availability in outlying areas may depend on the scope of work. There may be a small travel fee for locations beyond our standard service area, which we'll always discuss during the estimate process.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">5. How are your prices determined?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Our pricing is based on several factors including the scope of work, tree size, location, accessibility, and any special equipment needs. We provide free, no-obligation estimates after assessing your specific situation. Our pricing is competitive and reflects our high standards for quality, safety, and professionalism. We're happy to provide itemized quotes that break down all costs so you understand exactly what you're paying for. Payment terms are discussed when we provide the estimate.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">6. Do I need a permit for tree work?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Permit requirements vary by municipality and tree species. In many cases, especially for tree removal or significant pruning of protected species, permits are required. Our team is familiar with local tree ordinances throughout our service area and will advise you on necessary permits. For properties with landmark status or in historic districts, additional approvals may be needed. We can handle the permit application process for you, including any required documentation or arborist reports.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">7. What is your process for tree removal?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Our tree removal process begins with a thorough assessment by a certified arborist to evaluate the tree's health and structure. We'll discuss alternatives to removal when possible. If removal is necessary, we'll develop a detailed plan considering access, equipment needs, and safety precautions. Our crew uses specialized rigging techniques to remove trees safely, even in tight spaces. All debris is chipped and removed from your property unless otherwise arranged. Stump grinding is available as an additional service.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">8. How often should my trees be pruned?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Most trees benefit from pruning every 3-5 years, though this can vary by species, age, and location. Young trees may need more frequent pruning (every 2-3 years) to establish good structure. Mature trees typically require less frequent attention. Our arborists will provide specific recommendations for your trees based on their assessment. Routine pruning helps maintain tree health, reduces storm damage risk, and enhances appearance. We follow ANSI A300 pruning standards for all work.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">9. Can you help with diseased trees?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Yes, diagnosing and treating tree diseases is a specialty of our team. We're experienced with common urban tree ailments like Dutch elm disease, oak wilt, anthracnose, and more. Treatment options vary depending on the disease and may include cultural practices, fungicide treatments, or in some cases, removal to prevent spread. Early intervention is key, so contact us at the first signs of trouble like unusual leaf spots, premature defoliation, or dieback. We'll provide a diagnosis and recommend the most effective treatment plan.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">10. What's the best time to plant trees?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">In our climate, the ideal times for planting are early spring (March-May) and early fall (September-October). These cooler seasons allow trees to establish roots without the stress of summer heat. However, container-grown trees can be planted year-round with proper care. We'll help select the right species for your site conditions and provide detailed planting and care instructions. Proper planting technique is crucial for long-term tree health - we follow research-based methods to give your new trees the best start.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">11. How do I know if my tree is dangerous?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Warning signs of a potentially hazardous tree include large dead branches, cracks in the trunk, significant lean, fungal growth at the base, or roots lifting the soil. Cavities or decay in the trunk or major limbs may also indicate structural weakness. If you notice any of these signs, contact us for a professional assessment. Our arborists use specialized tools to evaluate tree stability and can recommend appropriate action, which may range from monitoring to pruning or removal if serious hazards are present.</p>

Payment is due upon completion of the work unless otherwise arranged. For larger projects, we may require a deposit upfront with the balance due upon completion. We also offer financing options through third-party providers to help make our services more accessible. Please inquire about payment options when scheduling your service or during the estimate process.</p>

If you're not completely satisfied with the work performed, please let us know within 30 days, and we will address your concerns. For specific services like tree planting, we provide a warranty period during which we will replace any dead trees due to our planting errors.
