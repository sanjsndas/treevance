                        <p class="text-gray-600">Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently and provide information to website owners. Cookies can be "session" (deleted when you close your browser) or "persistent" (remain until deleted or expired). They serve various functions like remembering preferences, analyzing site usage, and enabling certain functionality. Other technologies like web beacons and tracking pixels work similarly to cookies in collecting information. Modern browsers allow users to control cookie settings and delete existing cookies.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">We use several types of cookies: essential cookies required for website operation, functionality cookies to remember your preferences, performance/analytics cookies to understand user behavior, and marketing cookies for targeted advertising. Essential cookies cannot be disabled as they're necessary for core functionality. Analytics cookies help us improve the website by collecting anonymous usage data. Advertising cookies help us deliver relevant marketing messages based on your interests. You can manage non-essential cookies through our consent manager tool.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">3. Essential Cookies</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">Essential cookies are strictly necessary for the website to function properly. They enable basic features like page navigation and access to secure areas. Without these cookies, services you request cannot be provided. They are typically set in response to actions like logging in or filling forms. These cookies don't store personally identifiable information. Most browsers allow blocking cookies, but this may make some site features unavailable. We don't require consent for essential cookies under applicable privacy laws.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting anonymous information. This data includes pages visited, time spent on pages, and error messages encountered. The information is aggregated and helps us improve site performance and user experience. We use Google Analytics for this purpose, which uses cookies to track traffic patterns. You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking. These cookies don't collect information that identifies visitors personally. Performance cookies help us identify popular content and technical issues.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Functionality cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (like language preferences) and provide enhanced features. They may be set by us or third-party providers whose services we've added to pages. Without these cookies, certain features will be unavailable or less personalized. They may also be used to provide services you've requested like watching videos. The information collected is anonymous and doesn't track browsing on other sites. These cookies improve user experience by remembering preferences across visits. You can block them, but some site features may not work as expected.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Advertising cookies are used to deliver advertisements that may be relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit how often you see an ad and measure campaign effectiveness. These cookies track browsing habits and may share this information with other organizations. We may use them to show you Treevance ads on other websites. You can opt-out of targeted advertising through various consumer choice tools. Note that opting out doesn't mean you won't see ads - just that they'll be less relevant. These cookies require your explicit consent through our cookie banner.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">We sometimes embed content from third parties like YouTube or social media platforms, which may set their own cookies. These third parties may collect data about your online activities across websites. We don't control these cookies and you should check the third party's cookie policy. Some third-party cookies are used for advertising, analytics, or social sharing features. We carefully select reputable third parties but aren't responsible for their cookie practices. Many third parties offer opt-out mechanisms for their tracking technologies. You can block third-party cookies in your browser settings.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Cookies have varying lifespans: session cookies expire when you close your browser, persistent cookies remain longer according to their expiration date. Some cookies expire within hours or days while others may last for years. We regularly review and update cookie expiration periods. You can delete cookies in your browser settings at any time. Expired cookies are automatically deleted by your browser. We set reasonable cookie durations based on their purpose. Persistent cookies will reapply if you don't clear them between visits.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">You can control cookies through your browser settings to block or delete them. Most browsers allow you to view currently stored cookies and selectively delete them. You can typically set rules to accept cookies only from certain sites. Browser settings vary but are usually found under Privacy or Security sections. Blocking all cookies may impact website functionality. Our cookie consent banner provides granular control over non-essential cookies. You can revisit preferences anytime through a link in our footer. Mobile devices may have additional controls in their operating systems.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Under GDPR, we require your consent for non-essential cookies. Our cookie banner provides clear information and options before setting these cookies. Consent is obtained before loading non-essential cookies. You can withdraw consent at any time by updating preferences. We keep a record of your consent to comply with data protection regulations. Essential cookies don't require consent but you can block them in browser settings. Our approach aligns with EU guidance on cookie consent and the ePrivacy Directive.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">California residents have certain rights regarding data collection through cookies under CCPA. This includes the right to know about and opt-out of the "sale" of personal information (which may include some cookie-based tracking). We provide a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link for California users. CCPA also provides rights to access and delete personal information collected via cookies. We honor Global Privacy Control signals for opting out of cookie-based tracking. California users can designate authorized agents to exercise these rights.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Beyond cookies, we may use similar technologies like web beacons, pixels, and local storage. Web beacons are tiny graphics that track if you've visited certain pages. Local storage stores data in your browser similar to cookies but with more capacity. These technologies help with analytics, functionality and advertising. They're subject to similar consent requirements as cookies. You can often control them through browser settings alongside cookies. Some may be harder to control than standard cookies but we aim for transparency about all tracking methods.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">You can withdraw cookie consent at any time by updating your preferences. Withdrawing consent means future non-essential cookies won't be set. Existing cookies will remain until they expire or are deleted. To withdraw, use the cookie settings link in our footer. Some site features may stop working after withdrawal. Withdrawing doesn't affect the lawfulness of prior processing based on consent. You'll be asked for consent again after a set period or if you clear cookies. We make it as easy to withdraw as to give consent.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">We categorize cookies based on their purpose: Strictly Necessary (essential functions), Preferences (remember choices), Statistics (usage analysis), and Marketing (targeting ads). Each category has different implications for privacy and functionality. Our consent tool provides granular control by category. Some categories rely on third-party technologies with their own policies. We regularly review and update our cookie categorizations. The classifications help users make informed choices about which cookies to allow. Detailed lists of specific cookies are available in our cookie declaration.</p>

                        <p class=" text-gray-600">First-party cookies are set by our website and are used to enhance your experience, while third-party cookies are set by external services and can track your activity across different sites. First-party cookies help us remember your preferences and improve site functionality. Third-party cookies are often used for advertising and analytics purposes. You can manage both types of cookies through your browser settings. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third-party services to understand their data practices. Our cookie consent banner allows you to choose which types of cookies to accept.</p>
