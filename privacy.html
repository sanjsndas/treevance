We may share information with service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing and website hosting. These providers are contractually obligated to maintain confidentiality and security. Information may be disclosed if required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety.

Cookies are small data files stored on your device that help us understand user behavior and improve site functionality. We use both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until deleted). Third-party analytics services may also place cookies to help us understand how our services are used.

                        <p class="text-gray-600">We implement reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments. While we take appropriate precautions, no internet transmission or storage system can be guaranteed 100% secure. We restrict access to personal information to employees and contractors who need to know that information for business purposes. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account credentials you use to access our services.</p>

The retention period depends on the type of information and why we collected it. When no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize your information. Service records are typically retained for a minimum of seven years to comply with tax and regulatory requirements. You may request deletion of certain personal information as described in our data subject rights section.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Our services are not directed to children under 13 (or older where required by law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information. Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided us with personal information may contact us to request deletion. We encourage parents to monitor their children's online activities and teach them about internet safety.</p>

These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your jurisdiction. When we transfer personal information internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards as required by applicable laws. This may include standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or other valid transfer mechanisms. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information to these locations.</p>

You may also have the right to object to or restrict certain processing activities or request a copy of your data in a portable format. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information below. We will respond to your request within the time required by applicable law. We may need to verify your identity before processing certain requests. Some rights may be limited if fulfilling the request would violate legal obligations or adversely affect others.</p>

California residents may request deletion of personal information and opt-out of "sales" of personal information (though we do not sell information). You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights. The CCPA also provides a right to not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising privacy rights.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600">For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Under GDPR, you have rights including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection to processing. Our legal basis for processing is typically contractual necessity, legitimate interest, or consent where required. You may withdraw consent at any time without affecting prior processing. We have appointed a Data Protection Officer who can be contacted at privacy@treevance.com. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe your rights have been violated.</p>

This privacy policy does not apply to those third-party sites, and we are not responsible for their content or privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement of the linked site.

                        <p class="text-gray-600">Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that sends signals to websites requesting not to track browsing activity. Our website does not currently respond to DNT signals as there is no standard for how to respond. However, we provide other opt-out mechanisms for certain tracking technologies through our cookie preferences tool. You can adjust your browser settings to control tracking technologies directly. The exact opt-out options available depend on your browser and device settings. We respect your privacy choices and provide transparency about our data practices.</p>

App permissions allow you to control what information the app can access. We use push notifications to communicate important service information, which you can manage in your device settings. The app may periodically connect to our servers to check for updates and download new content. Usage data helps us analyze performance and improve the app experience. Mobile app users are subject to the same privacy protections as web users.</p>
